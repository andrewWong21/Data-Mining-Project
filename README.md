Building a rule-based classifier indirectly by extracting rulesets from decision trees generated on attribute splitting using the Gini index and entropy as impurity measures, then calculating the supports, confidences, and lifts of the resulting rules.

Creating a Naive Bayes classifier using the scikit-learn library and evaluating the accuracy, precision, and recall of models trained on the full dataset and using a 3-1 train/test split.
